# Hi there, I'm Murilo Esteves Nogueira 👋 🧬🦾

### MSc in Health | Graduate Student in Mathematical Modeling & Applied Computing

I am a researcher bridging the gap between Human Movement Sciences and **Computational Neuroscience**. With an MSc from the Faculty of Medicine (UFMS), I am currently specializing in **Mathematical Modeling** and **Data Science** to develop neurotechnology.

**🎯 Research Interest & Future Goal:** I am preparing for PhD research to develop BCI and assistive solutions for stroke recovery, specifically targeting **hemiplegia** and **hemispatial neglect** (heminigligência).
