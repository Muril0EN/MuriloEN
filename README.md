# Hi there, I'm Murilo Esteves Nogueira 👋 🧬🦾

### MSc in Health | Mathematics Student | Data Scientist | C++ & Arduino Developer

I am a researcher bridging the gap between Human Movement Sciences and **Computational Neuroscience**. With an MSc from the Faculty of Medicine (UFMS), I am currently focusing on technical skill acquisition in **mathematical modeling**, **Data Science**, and **embedded systems**.

**🎯 Research Interest & Future Goal:** I am preparing for PhD research to develop neurotechnology and BCI solutions for stroke recovery, with a specific interest in addressing **hemiplegia** and **hemispatial neglect** (heminigligência).
